# Upstart Case Study
## Overview and Origin of Upstart
<br> Upstart was founded in 2012 by Dave Girouard, the former President of Google, and is headquartered in San Mateo, California. He started the company selling an Income Share Agreement product, connecting young entrepreneurs with investors, but he decided to go into the personal loan industry instead in 2014. According to Upstart's website, its mission is to enable effortless credit because "unless youâ€™re one of the few percent of Americans with significant wealth, the price of borrowing affects you every day".
<br> Upstart raised a $1.75M seed round from many famous investors including Google Ventures and Mark Cuban. They subsequently raised a series A round of $5.9M which included Eric Schmidt (Google Executive Chairman). Upstart raised a Series C round of $35M from Third Point Capital in 2015 and $32.5M from Rakuten in 2017. Upstart raised a Series D round of $50M from The Progressive Corporation in 2019.
<br> Upstart priced its initial public offering at $20 in 2010 for market cap of $1.45 billion. It surpassed $20 billion in 2021. Today, it is worth $2.74 billion.
## Business Activities
<br> Upstart operates a cloud-based AI lending platform that connects its bank partners to people looking for a loan. This means that both banks and loan seekers are its customer.  
<br> The thing that makes Upstart unique is that instead of giving loans like a normal bank, it  builds loan products for banks and offers quotes on behalf of banks using AI technology.
## Landscape
<br> Upstart works in the lending industry, and it is not the only company implementing AI innovations. As of now, companies in the same AI based lending domain as Upstart include Float, Plaid, Kiavi, Affirm and Earnest.
<br> The uses of AI technology to decide who can get approved for a loan makes these companies unique because most Banks still use the traditional credit score to decide who can get approved for a loan.
<br> Upstart, like many other companies, is also going Digital First so most employees can live and work anywhere in the U.S. 
## Results
<br> Upstart is one of the first company to successfully apply AI to the multi-trillion dollar loan industry.
<br> In Q1 of 2022, Ustart was able to achieve 74% Fully automated loans, its highest percentage ever. Fully automated loans are loans that from initial rate request to final funding require no human involvement. 
<br> Some core metrics that companies like UPST use to measure success include: revenue growth vs industry average, return on equity, return on assets, profit margin growth, and debt to equity ratio.
<br> Upstart's revenue (256.77% per year) has grown faster than the US Credit Services industry average revenue (12.15%).
<br> Upstart's has a Return on Equity of 20.3%. Generally, a return on equity of 15-20% is good and shows that a company is efficient at transforming shareholder equity into returns.
<br> Upstart is generating lower Return on Assets (10%) than the US Credit Services industry average (15.15%).
<br> Upstart's profit margin has increased by +10.2% in the last year (from 5% to 15.2%).
<br> Upstart's debt to equity ratio (1.27) is considered high (bad).
## Recommendations
<br> I would advise against Upstart having multiple products and services and instead focus on selling their core loan products. Apple, the most successful company in the world by market cap, makes over 50% it's revenue from Iphones (58% in Q1 of 2022).  
<br> I would suggest improving their website and make it less frustrating to use as a means to increase the sale of its current loan products as it is the most obvious problem that I can see. Currently whenever I go to their website, I need to complete a captcha test, and it makes me what to leave the website. More marketing is also advised because not many people know about upstart, and I have only seen upstart adds on YouTube.
